ROCO_81846	 Example of a modern artwork that lacks visual beauty (Fountain by Duchamps, 1917, © Succession Marcel Duchamp/VG Bild-Kunst and Bonn, 2015). Many art historians consider this porcelain urinal a major landmark artwork of modern art. Its importance in art history stems not so much from the intrinsic beauty of its form, but from the fact that the artist transcended traditional artistic principles and thereby set the stage for modern conceptual art. In the process of establishing (post-)modern art, many artists abandoned the concept of beauty as a prerequisite for artworks. In the model, this is reflected in the decrease or absence of perceptual processing. As a result, aesthetic experience is determined largely by the content and context of the artwork (i.e., predominant aesthetics of cognition), irrespective of its form.

ROCO_81880	 Illustration of the concept of memory reconsolidation. The consolidated drug memory, established by repeated Pavlovian association with an environmental stimulus (CS) and self-administered drug effect, is stored in a stable state. Brief presentations of the drug CS (called ‘reactivation’) can result in destabilization of the memory in the brain (in the case of a CS–drug memory, in the basolateral amygdala). The memory can persist in the brain if it is restabilized through de novo protein synthesis. The protein ZIF268 is a requirement of cued drug memory reconsolidation in the basolateral amygdala and is regulated by activation of NMDA receptors. Memory reconsolidation can be prevented by inhibiting protein synthesis in the amygdala, or knocking down ZIF268 by infusing zif268 antisense oligonucleotides, or by blocking NMDA or β-adrenoceptors. Systemic NMDA or β-adrenoceptor blockade also prevents drug memory reconsolidation. The result is drug memory ‘erasure’ with the consequence that the drug-associated CS can no longer support drug seeking and thereby prevents relapse (see Milton & Everitt, 2010, for review).

ROCO_82185	 Schematic depiction of a proposed model of the relationship between cell stress, translocation of hAgo2 to SGs and loss of RNAi. Active siRNA- and miRNA-induced RNAi occur in the functional compartment (right side), which includes the cytosol, the nucleus and PBs under non-stress conditions. The non-functional compartment includes SGs (left side) to which hAgo2 migrates under stress conditions. Since the hAgo2-related extent of RNAi is reversibly linked with cell stress we assume exchange of hAgo2 between both compartments, i.e. a kind of steady state. The non-functional compartment contains transient structures composed of stalled preinitiation complexes and untranslated mRNA, which are known as SGs. Under cellular stress conditions the equilibrium is perturbed and hAgo2 accumulates in SGs. This may circumvent the functional interactions of hAgo2 with other RNAi involved proteins which induces the exclusion of hAgo2 from the RNAi pathway.

This stage of development is prior to endochondral ossification. Chondrocytes at various stages of differentiation are present at this stage: precursor chondrocytes (PC) are found at the most proximal end of the developing tibia as well as in the surrounding perichondrium; differentiated chondrocytes (DC) are located further down the developing limb and are distinguishable by their cuboidal or flattened phenotype, depending on their location; hypertrophic chondrocytes (HYP) are terminally-differentiated cells easily distinguished by their increased size. Also shown in this image are the developing femoral condyles (fc) of the distal femur. Scale bar = 250 µm.

ROCO_82371	 The EcoSac230 bag is inserted through a 12-mm trocar.
ROCO_82372	 Once the mass has been enucleated, intraoperative upper endoscopy is performed to check for violation of the esophageal mucosa. The esophagus is submerged under water and the endoscope is used to insufflate air into the esophagus, causing the mucosa to bulge at the myotomy site. This allows the surgeon to identify any sites of perforation, as air bubbles will be seen escaping from the lumen at the site of mucosal injury. Mucosal perforation is uncommon, but intraoperative assessment is mandatory and, when identified, is easily repaired with minimal risk of postoperative complication. Most mucosal injuries can be repaired with simple interrupted 2-0 or 3-0 absorbable suture. Larger defects can be closed with suture or a linear endoscopic stapler using a vascular load. A 54-French bougie should be carefully passed under direct thoracoscopic vision prior to attempting stapled repair in order to avoid excessive narrowing of the lumen.

ROCO_82376	 Beaker that contained the stimulus solutions.Inserted into the beaker were two HPLC filters through which air flowed to create bubbles. Subjects sampled the solutions by inserting the tip of their tongue over the near HPLC filter. Under the control of a solenoid valve, bubbles could be presented under the tongue (as shown, or away from the tongue (by directing air to the further HPLC filter). In the background, a computer monitor is visible (subjects could see it clearly). On the monitor is an LMS scale. Subjects continuously tracked bite intensity by moving a mouse that controlled the height of blue bar next to the LMS.
ROCO_82378	 Hypothesis: a possible perspective on myeloma growth. Green cells represent plasma cells; yellow cells represent cancer stem cells/myeloma progenitors. This model proposes that the number of plasma cells accurately reflects the number of generative cancer stem cells prior to therapy, after diagnosis or in relapse (left panel) but does not bear a numerical relationship to cancer stem cells in remission (right panel). We speculate that this may be due to selective killing of plasma cells by therapy that spares cancer stem cells. In this context, the pre-treatment VDJ% may correlate with EFS because it is an indirect measure of cancer stem cell activity.

ROCO_82398	 Irreplaceability hotspots of the endemic threatened marine chondrichthyans.Endemics were defined as species with an Extent of Occurrence of <500,000 km2 (n = 66). Irreplaceable cells with the greatest number of small range species are shown in red, with blue cells showing areas of lower, but still significant irreplaceability. Irreplaceability is the sum of the inverse of the geographic range sizes of all threatened endemic species in the cell. A value of 0.1 means that on average a single cell represents one tenth of the global range of all the species present in the cell. The numbers are hotspots referred to in the text.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00590.016

ROCO_82414	 The myth of the Titan Prometheus provides an icon for RegMed. Prometheus was known as the benefactor of mankind for his desire to assist mortals and give them many beneficial gifts that helped them to survive and live prosperous lives. His duty as a god was to form man from water and earth, and in doing so, gave them each a gift of strength or speed, craftiness or wisdom, and many other benefactors that improved their ways of living. The most well-known gift of Prometheus was the gift of fire which Prometheus stole from Zeus’ lightning bolts. Prometheus’ defiance and betrayal provoked Zeus to have him chained to Mount Caucasus, where an eagle ate daily from his ever-regenerating liver. As an immortal Titan, Prometheus’ liver grew by night what the eagle had eaten the day before. His torture lasted 30,000 years until he was freed by Hercules.

ROCO_82423	 Cross-linear tension forces within the cell.Cell Example: For a = 4.4 nN, we have the domain max and min values of Ki & Tcl-i in correspondence to gray values, each of which is labeled by a value “i”. For each label value “i” corresponds an interval of possible cross-linear tensions Tcl-i, ranging from Tcl-max-i to Tcl-min-i. Since the amount of actin detected increase as a pixel gets brighter, i.e. as the label value “i” increases, Ki& Tcl increase as well. When we refer to Tcl-max we in fact refer to Tcl-max-10, the highest cross-linear tension value.

ROCO_82508	 The operating surgeon stands on the right side of the table, facing the patient’s back. The assistant stands on the left side of the table, facing the patient’s front. Five thoracoscopic ports are placed. The 5 or 10 mm camera port is placed first, located in the posterior axillary line in the 7th or 8th intercostal space. The remaining ports are placed under direct thoracoscopic vision using a 30-degree scope. A 5 or 10 mm port is placed in line with the tip of the scapula posteriorly in the 7th or 8th intercostal space and serves as the surgeon’s right-handed working port. A 5 mm port is placed one intercostal space below the tip of the scapula for the surgeon’s left-handed working port. A 10 mm port is placed in the 4th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line for the lung retractor. If a second assistant is available, an additional 5 mm port can be placed in the 6th intercostal for an additional retraction port or for a suction-irrigator.

ROCO_82622	 A series of self-promoting vicious cycles triggered by Aβ/CaSR signaling mediates the oversecretion of endogenously produced Aβ42 oligomers from ever increasing numbers of human cortical neurons and astrocytes and of NO and VEGF-A from the latter.Such neurotoxins drive the slow yet progressive dissemination of LOAD neuropathology to cognition-related areas of the cerebral cortex. These harmful effects concurrently causing the death of increasing numbers of cortical neurons are utterly suppressed by allosteric CaSR antagonist NPS 2143.Therefore, calcilytics could halt LOAD progression (Dal Prà et al., 2014a, b, c).

ROCO_82627	 Human placental hemochorial placentation. While hCG and hyperglycosylated hCG force villous trophoblast tissue formation [13-17], hCG promotes the development and growth of uterine spiral arteries [19-26]. Angiogenesis forces the protrusion of arteries to reach invading villous trophoblast tissue [19-26]. hCG also promotes the formation of the umbilical circulation in villous tissue and the formation of the umbilical cord [27-32]. All linked together, villous trophoblast tissue, maternal spiral artery blood and fetal umbilical circulation and you have hemochorial placentation, efficient fetal nutrient exchange, as illustrated. In hemochorial placentation, spiral artery bring maternal blood into one of 4-7 hemochorial placentation chambers. Blood fills the chamber, nutrients (oxygen/glucse/amino acids) them pass across syncytiotrophoblast cells into villous side-arms or floating villi. They are then rapidly absorbed by the umbilical circulation.

ROCO_82766	 Schematic summary of signaling cascades which contribute to the osmotic expression of the NFAT5 gene in RPE cells. The NaCl-induced expression of the NFAT5 gene is fully dependent on intracellular calcium signaling mediated by phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol triphosphate (IP3)-induced release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as well as on activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Autocrine/paracrine purinergic receptor signaling, as well as activation of further receptors like the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor, may induce release of calcium from intracellular stores. High extracellular NaCl induces a release of ATP from the cells which activates calcium-permeable P2X7 receptors and metabotropic P2Y2 receptors. Extracellular ATP is converted to ADP by the ectonucleotidase nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (NTPDase2); ADP activates P2Y1 receptors. P2 receptor signaling results in activation of nucleoside transporters, which mediate a release of adenosine that activates A1 receptors. Intracellular calcium signaling results in activation of calcium-dependent enzymes, such as protein kinase C (PKC), calpains, and PLA2. In addition to PKA and Src tyrosine kinases, these enzymes contribute to activation of multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways, including extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathways. One of the transcription factors mediating activation of the NFAT5 gene is nuclear factor κB (NF-κB).
ROCO_82767	 The vascular wall in patients with diabetes is well known to have advanced atherosclerosis.Notes: The wall stress increases stress on the diseased diabetes vascular wall leading to plaque fracture. The thin cap is not as elastic, and the stiffness of this plaque cap increases the risk for plaque rupture. In addition, the cap frequently is much thinner with a necrotic core as seen in the PROSPECT trial.23,49Abbreviations: BP, blood pressure; NIRS, near infrared spectroscopy; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; OCT, optical coherence tomography; NO, nitric oxide.

ROCO_83001	 Demonstrates age estimation in the African elephant using the Age Reference Line.A straight line is drawn from Point A at the base of the mandibular foramen to Point B at the most distal point of molar occlusal wear. A line is drawn or vizualised along the ridge of the medial mandible (Line C). The two lines intersect at the red dot, Point D, which has been termed the Age Reference Point (ARP). A measurement of 10 cm is made from this point passing centrally through the distal molar. In this example 10 cm is marked as the distance from ARP (Point D) to the yellow line at E. This yellow line at E is termed the Age Reference Line (ARL). In this example the ARL falls on the 7th lamella (L) of the 4th molar. By reference to this ARL in Table 1 the elephant’s age can be estimated as 11.5 years. The green arrow at the mesial end of the mandible marks the mesial end of the dental alveolus, named the ‘crest’.

ROCO_83076	 Experimental lung infection - Impact of infection route. The sketch highlights the differential experimental set-up for intranasal and intratracheal infection in mice. Compared to an intranasal infection route the intratracheal instillation bypasses the initial host immune response conducted by the respiratory epithelium of the upper airways and deposits more bacteria into the distal airways. The basic defect in CF impairs the mucociliary clearance [48]. Ciliated respiratory epithelium is abundant in the upper and conducting airways, decreasing with the increasing branching of the airways. Correspondingly mucociliary clearance plays a prominent role for the elimination of the pathogen from these compartments, but not from the alveolar space. Please note the differential abundance of respiratory epithelium in the upper airways (right photograph) and the lower conducting airways of mice (left photograph).

ROCO_83215	 Evolution of internal abdominal cavity perimeter during increase in volume. In case of gynoid obesity, the internal abdominal perimeter is shaped as an ellipse. Patients with an ellipse‐shaped internal perimeter have a huge stretching capacity (and thus very good abdominal compliance); this is illustrated with the progression of the shape from ellipse (dotted line) at baseline to a sphere (solid line) at very high intra-abdominal pressures (IAP) obtained during laparoscopy. The arrows show the centripetal movement of the lateral edges of the ellipse and a centrifugal movement of the cranio‐caudal edges. During increase in intra-abdominal volume (IAV) from baseline to stretched and maximal stretched IAV, the difference between the long and short axes of the ellipse decreases, while the internal perimeter and surface area increase. At maximal stretch, the external and internal abdominal perimeter are equal. Patients with android obesity do not have this reshaping and stretching capability. Adapted from [2] with permission

The rank order of VCCs density in the entire OB was AOB>OB core>GRO>Gl>MI>the others in the SOD1 wild-type mice and G93A transgenic mice. The amount of vimentin positive cells gradually increased from the pre-onset to onset to progression stages in the OB core and Gl of the SOD1 G93A transgenic mice, the most significant increase of vimentin positive cells was in the OB core region at the progression stage, almost all increased vimentin positive cells were the astrocyte cells.

ROCO_83232	 Landmarking the OP.The distribution along the bone edges of four landmarks (LM, yellow, red border) and 14 semilandmarks (yellow) used in this study, in a smelt (Osmerus mordax, Osmeridae). Developmental studies in zebrafish, stickleback, cory catfish, and Oncorhynchus species inform the positions of the landmarks, those that appear to correspond among all of the species examined [15,29,30], and unpublished: These landmarks include LM1 (joint-associated), LM2 (socket of the ball-and-socket joint the OP makes with the hyomandibula), LM6 (ventral apex) and LM12 (posterior apex, associated with a prominent strut that Gregory termed a tract of folded trabeculae [14] traversing the bone from the joint region). The opercular dilator muscle connects to the OP at LM1. The opercular levator muscles connect between LM1 and LM12. The prominent curvature at LM9 is also shared among many species, including zebrafish (termed ‘c’ in [15]. The semilandmarks were placed either at constant intervals along the appropriate segment of the edge, or to capture elaborations of the edge in particular species. There is no basis currently for supposing that any of the semlandmarks capture homologous locations among the families, even though some them appear consistent among species within families.

Twelve measurements of fibril diameter, fibril separation distance, and D-periodicity from the central cornea were used (white circles) to produce weighted averages for each treatment group (Table 1). Measurements across the horizontal meridian of each cornea (circles containing a line) were averaged within treatment groups to show limbus-to-limbus changes in fibril separation distance and fibril diameter (Figure 3). The position of the limbus is shown as a dashed black line. A scleral suture at the 12 o’clock position ensured that in vivo corneal orientation was maintained during data collection.

ROCO_83488	 Lateral view on an Utricularia australis trap. The trap entrance (te) faces left, and the trigger hairs which protrude from the trapdoor are slightly visible (see Fig. 4 for a SEM image). The trap possesses antennae (an) and bristles (br) for guiding prey organisms grazing algae on the trap towards the entrance, and lateral flexible trap walls (tw). The trapdoor is fixed along the upper part of the trap entrance (its median axes in different phases (a–c) are indicated as solid grey lines), whereas the motile lower trapdoor edge rests on the threshold (th, indicated by a solid white line). When the trap is set and ready to ‘fire’, the door is (a) bulged outwards (convex) and highly sensitive to mechanical perturbations. When prey triggers the trap by touching the trigger hairs, the trapdoor (b) becomes ‘unlocked’ by inverting its curvature to concave. Afterwards (c), it swings open and water and prey are sucked into the trap. After attaining a phase of maximum opening, the trapdoor re-closes by an inverted motion sequence and finally regains the initial convex curvature.

ROCO_83794	 Model of VS development.Myocardial (violett), endocardial (orange) and most likely trabecular cilia (turquoise) regulate proliferation at distinct cardiac regions. In the ventricles, the cell proliferation in these regions results in wall thickness control, trabecular formation and a push of cells toward the base of the muscular ventricular septum (indicated by pink arrows). ECC cilia (yellow) seem to be different from the other cardiac cilia, since they do not regulate ECC proliferation. LA, left atrium; RA, right atrium; LV, left ventricle; RV, right ventricle; muVS, muscular ventricular septum.

ROCO_84024	 Differences between MRIDT and HistST orientations displayed on an FA map. MRIDT and HistST orientations are plotted in a color range from green (for orientations that perfectly agree) to red (for orientations that differ by 90°). Bar length reflects the projection length of the diffusion tensor in the sectioning plane. There is a generally good histology-DTI agreement for high FA values, especially in white matter. For lower FA, particularly when entering gray matter, there are three cases: (A) Good agreement in case of predominant radial orientations, (B) Moderate to weak agreement, (C) Perpendicular histology-DT orientedness. Here, voxels are located well within gray matter and run in bands parallel to the cortical surface. Scale bar: 5 mm.

ROCO_84027	 Measurement and calculation of alveolar bone mineral density (al-BMD). To standardize the brightness and contrast among pictures taken on different days, an X-ray was taken in a healthy person, and a histogram of the color bar on the reference picture was normalized, followed by calculation of the reference mean and standard variation. Lines were drawn from the apex of the root, parallel to the boundary of the cement–enamel junction, and halfway between the cement–enamel junction and the apex of the root. Lines were then also drawn perpendicular to those at the mesial and distal spaces of the first premolar. The X-ray film density in the area of the resulting rectangle was measured by first dividing the area into pixels with sides of 1/1,534 cm in length. The brightness in each pixel was compared with a scale consisting of 256 grades of brightness. Comparisons could then be made between films taken at different times for different individuals

ROCO_84034	 The complexity of the brain. Artistic composition showing a coronal histological section of the human brain and a hand holding a pin with a pinhead (approximately 1 mm3) to graphically illustrate the complexity of the brain. In a volume of human cerebral cortex similar to the pinhead in this figure, there are about 27,000 neurons and 1000 million synapses (Alonso-Nanclares et al., 2008). The diameter of the pin (0.5 mm) is equivalent to the thickness of a cortical column. Since a human pyramidal neuron typically has a dendritic tree with a minimum total length of several mm, in this volume there would be several thousand mm of dendrites. Taking a medium-sized pyramidal neuron with a dendritic length of 10 mm as an example, and considering that pyramidal cells represent approximately 80% of the total population (see text for further details) there would be approximately 216 m of pyramidal cell dendrites in this 1 mm3. Furthermore, the brain is one of the organs of the body with the highest metabolic demands and thus, there is a very dense network of blood vessels in association with the neurons and glia (see e.g., Blinder et al., 2013; Magistretti and Allaman, 2015; Yuan et al., 2015). Taken from DeFelipe (2014).

The access angle (a) could be decreased to have a shallower approach without increasing the risk of violating the epidural space. B : When the height of a neural foramen, d, is smaller than the diameter of an obturator, it is engaged between the annulus and pedicle before the tip enters the epidural space.

ROCO_84122	 Screenshot of stereology software. The grid positioned on this slide is 40 x 40 mm (i.e., the grid resolution). The number of times the lines intersect within the boundaries of the liver is 13. Since each point of intersection represents 4 × 4 or 16 cm2, the total area occupied by the liver is estimated as 13 × 4 × 4 or 208 cm2. When an intersect falls on the border of the measured object, then a predefined corner is evaluated. Our radiologist opted for the upper right corner before the start of the study. If the right upper corner (or any corner chosen before the start of the study) is occupied by the object of interest, then the whole intersect is regarded as occupied by the liver. Otherwise, the intersection is considered to have fallen beyond the borders of the object of interest and is not included in the measurements

ROCO_84165	 Directional optical coherence tomography tricolor composite image. Regions of the spectral-domain optical coherence tomography image that are grayscale indicate structures that scatter equally when imaged from each direction. Blue, red and green structures are those that preferentially scatter when light is incident from the left, center and right directions, respectively. If misdirected cones were present, the inner segment/outer segment junction would have appeared within the lesion, but with a blue or red color indicating the pointing direction. Although there are some weak directional reflections originating within the lesion, there is no evidence of misdirected cones. Immediately posterior to the external limiting membrane centrally there is color (white arrowhead), indicating some directionally reflective structures in a location normally seen in grayscale. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

ROCO_84169	 Oxidative stress and the role of lipids related to ethanol metabolism in the brain. Ethanol intake undergoes first pass metabolism in the stomach, intestine, and liver, although excess ethanol reaches the brain. Ethanol metabolism increases oxidative stress and lipid oxidation occurs, affecting mitochondrial membrane phospholipids and provoking cell death, thereby provoking damage in the brain. However ethanol-induced damage can be avoided by the activation of compensatory mechanisms involving lipids: E (ethanolamine), PE (phosphatidylethanolamine), acyl-E (acyl-ethanolamine), and NAPE (N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine).

ROCO_84334	 Transmission wide-angle X-ray scattering from the sample in Figure 1 with the beam incident at ω = 45°, so the three main labeled reflections are rotated in the laboratory frame according to formula11 that also gives the q values in the caption to Figure 2. The first satellites of the (1,1) and (1,–1) are visible, as are the overlapping second satellites15 centered on the equator (qr = 0), which follows a trajectory from the beam toward the (20) reflection. The weak ring closer to the beam than the WAXS reflections is from a Mylar window on the sample chamber and occurs because of imperfect subtraction of the background obtained from a substrate with no lipid. The intensity of the beam on the charge-coupled device was highly attenuated by an absorber downstream from the sample, and there are no lamellar reflections for large incidence angles ω.

ROCO_84522	 Optimal brain targets of stimulation for therapeutic purposes. rTMS targeting the premotor regions and supplementary motor area (SMA, colored in blue) has been demonstrated as the most plausible site of stimulation for reducing hyperkinetic motor disorders in PD patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Moreover, either the premotor or the primary motor cortices (colored in red) are the most frequently used cortical targets for dystonic patients. Finally, based on the literature, the cerebellum (colored in green) has been proposed as the best target for maximizing the effectiveness of rTMS in patients with essential tremor. Of interest, the premotor region is an effective region for two hyperkinetic disorders: dyskinesias and dystonia (colored in red/blue). Figure summarizes (Koch et al., 2005; Brusa et al., 2006; Tyvaert et al., 2006; Popa et al., 2013).

ROCO_84623	 Lesions located in the distal 5 cm of the esophagus or at the gastroesophageal junction are more easily approached laparoscopically. Depending on the surgeon’s preference, the patient is positioned supine or in modified lithotomy. In the authors’ practice, the patient is supine; the operating surgeon stands on the right side of the table and the assistant on the left. A footboard facilitates steep reverse Trendelenberg positioning. To avoid potential injury to any abdominal viscera or organs, the initial port is placed via an open cut-down technique. The 10 mm port is placed two-thirds the distance from the xiphoid to the umbilicus and slightly off the midline in the right upper quadrant for the surgeon’s right-handed working port. The remaining 4 ports are then placed under direct laparoscopic vision. Another 5 or 10 mm port is placed in the left upper quadrant about one hands-breadth away from the initial port and will become the camera port. Bilateral 5 mm ports are placed just below the costal margin, approximately in the mid-clavicular line, for the surgeon’s left-hand and the assistant’s right hand. A 5 mm port in the right flank is used for the liver retractor.

ROCO_84888	 White thrombusWhite thrombus, consisting of platelet aggregates, is the target of antiplatelet therapy. I have been present on two occasions when patients had episodes of amaurosis fugax and so was able to observe by ophthalmoscopy the white thrombus oozing through the retinal arteries. As the white thrombus clears, the vision returns, sometimes in vertical or horizontal hemispheres, or in quadrants, as blood flow is restored to each main branch of the retinal artery. To the best of my knowledge, this phenomenon was first described by C. Miller Fisher; a patient who had amaurosis fugax was observed by many participants in Grand Rounds, taking turns with the ophthalmoscope.

ROCO_84980	 Example of a spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) frame that depicts the three boundaries that were automatically determined by our algorithm: (1) top surface of the retina, (2) the posterior retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and (3) the posterior retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The algorithm sequentially finds the top surface of the retina, the posterior RPE boundary, and then the posterior RNFL boundary. The depth difference between the top surface and the posterior RNFL boundary gives the RNFL thickness while the difference between the top surface and the posterior RPE boundary gives the retinal thickness (RT). The lateral dimension of this frame is 5.81 mm with a scan depth of 1.85 mm. The image was expanded vertically by 2 for better visualization.

ROCO_85202	 A beam (continuous line) sent by the transducer (G) crosses the superficial fat tissue and rectus abdominis muscle (M), and refracts medially on prismatic slow-conductive deep fat tissue (T). The base of the prism is made by the edge of the liver. Subsequently, ultrasounds reach the aorta (A) through soft tissues. Produced echoes undergo identical refraction (continuous line) on their way back to the probe. The monitor shows two vessels (Ar). They are located on a straight line created by the emitted beam (dashed/dotted line) (1, 4, 11). They are observed to the left and right from the medially situated genuine aorta (A). Duplication concerns not only the aorta, but also all structures located on the way of ultrasounds undergoing refraction. This image is clearer distally from the probe since alleged images are then separated by a greater distance. An abnormal presentation of the margin of the vertebral body located behind the aorta (visible from below) frequently confirms the presence of the artifact rather than genuine duplication(3)

ROCO_85697	 In vivo 3D CT scan of the head 1 week after placement of 5 craniotomies (exemplary scan, case 1, group 1). Two anterior craniotomies were grafted with HA; 2 posterior craniotomies were grafted with BCP (the left side is grafted in the presence of BMP-7). A control craniotomy nongrafted (left side lateral) remained unhealed at the end of the study, confirming the nature of the defect as a critical-size defect. The surface continuity of grafted area differs depending on the implant composition and in the presence of BMP-7. Cranial defects loaded with BMP-7 (left) are almost repaired. Nevertheless, apparently unrepaired surface (irregularities) in the BMP-7 group is composed of the newly mineralized bone, not assessable on CT but evident on ESEM (Fig. 4). Temporary volume changes on in vivo CT are appreciated in Figure 3 (volume-rendered CT image; iPlan CMF 3; BrainLAB, Feldkirchen, Germany).
ROCO_85698	 SHG image of an optical section taken about 100 µm below the cut surface of the corneal physical section. An area (cropped from a larger image) of approximately 6 × 4 images each 512 × 512 pixels in size is shown, using simple tiling without orientation correction, edge matching or any image processing. Bright features correspond to SHG scattering at 400 nm, in the forward (transmitted) direction, of laser light at 800 nm in approximately 140 fs pulses. SHG contrast in the image derives from a complex distribution of nonlinear susceptibility in non-centro-symmetric fibrillar collagen structures of varying diameters as well as linear scattering at both the primary and secondary wavelengths. The cross-sectional area of the microfocus X-ray beam is shown by a solid white rectangle and the cross-sectional area of a typical scan is shown by an open white rectangle.

ROCO_85734	 Skull illustrated in Samuel George Morton's Crania Americana [8].The 78 lithographs in Crania Americana set new standards for accuracy in anatomical illustration, as they were drawn carefully to scale and rechecked for accuracy multiple times, chiefly by John Collins [12],[13]. Indeed, the quality of the illustrations in this volume exceeds that of many modern publications. The remaining specimens in the Morton Collection are currently curated at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.
ROCO_85735	 Anatomy of Y-graft with two limbs anastomosed with superior mesenteric vein and splenic artery. After harvesting allograft from donor, arterial "Y-graft" is prepared on "back-table" with donor common iliac, internal, and external iliac arteries. Donor superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is anastomosed to donor external iliac artery limb of Y-graft, and donor splenic artery is anastomosed to donor internal iliac artery limb of Y-graft. Common iliac artery portion is then anastomosed to recipient's common iliac artery or external iliac artery.

ROCO_85946	 As researchers learn more about how metabolism and other functions are linked to circadian rhythm, some see the potential to identify small molecules that could be made into pharmaceuticals that would act on the core clock regulators to treat sleep disorders as well as obesity and related health effects. Others are looking at how changing the time when current drugs are taken may make them work better. For instance, in the September 2008 issue of The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Richard R. Almon and colleagues wrote that taking cholesterol-lowering statins at bedtime, as is currently recommended, may be less than optimal given that HMG-CoA reductase, the target for these drugs, has a maximal expression at approximately 10:00 a.m.

ROCO_86112	 Methods for measuring glucose metabolism in the human brain: Various techniques lend themselves to measuring glucose metabolism in the human brain. (1) Microdialysis, which allows metabolites in the extracellular fluid to be measured, is an invasive technique requiring insertion of a microdialysis catheter (possessing a semipermeable membrane, with nominal molecular weight cut-off typically 20 kDa or 100 kDa) into brain parenchyma. A pump is used to infuse perfusion fluid at a low flow rate (e.g. 0.3 μl/min) into the catheter and returned microdialysate is collected into small vials for subsequent analysis. (2) Imaging techniques include positron emission tomography (PET), which uses detectors to measure ionising radiation emitted from the glucose analogue FDG administered intravenously. This provides a measure of the uptake and phosphorylation of glucose. (3) 1H and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to measure lactate and high-energy phosphate compounds respectively, in different regions of the brain. (4) A global measure of uptake or release from the brain can be achieved by using a jugular bulb catheter, which allows the venous outflow of the brain to be sampled. Measured concentrations in blood sampled from the venous catheter can be compared with arterial concentrations of metabolites, typically measured in blood taken from an arterial line. This enables the net uptake or release of metabolites by the brain to be calculated and, if cerebral blood flow is known, the cerebral metabolic rate to be calculated

ROCO_86204	 Schematic illustration informs about three possible routes for the transport of morphogens within the renal stem cell niche. Mesenchymal (MES) and epithelial (EPI) cells are separated by an interface (asterisk) including textured extracellular matrix. Projections of mesenchymal cells cross it to establish cell-to-cell contacts via tunneling nanotubes. On this situation, it is speculated that morphogens with good solubility are transported by diffusion (1). Morphogens with minor solubility are secreted in interstitial fluid and then bound on extracellular matrix, where they are delivered on demand (2). Morphogens with poor solubility are transported in cell projections and tunneling nanotubes (3). The basal lamina of epithelial stem cells at the tip of a CD ampulla is labeled by a cross

This speculative assemblage-based technology proposes to harness the collective action of light sensitive droplets that are programmed to move towards the darkened foundations of the city to grow an artificial limestone reef. This structure aims to gradually spread the point load of the city over a much broader base than offered by the narrow woodpiles as well as providing new ecological niches for the marine wildlife.

ROCO_86460	 Skimmer clogging due to shock-wave interference.A cold supersonic plume is generated by expansion from a pulsed valve into a vacuum. A skimmer transmits the axial portion of the plume as a collimated beam into the detection chamber. With high beam densities, shock waves are reflected from the skimmer lip, interfering with the transmitted beam. In imaging experiments only, a discharge pulse from a high-voltage grid induces plasma glow in the denser portions of the flow, revealing the shock waves. A large split skimmer is used here for the observation of the internal shock structure.

ROCO_86462	 Proposed model of the transcriptional dynamics displayed in tendril tips and swarm center of a P. aeruginosa swarming colony. Tendril tip cells display an up-regulation of transcripts associated with energy production (ATP synthesis and cytochromes) and ribosomal proteins. At the same time, these cells down-regulate transcription associated with secreted factors (aka virulence factors) and iron acquisition. In contrast, swarm center cells live in a state in which oxidative and copper stress response transcripts are up-regulated.

ROCO_86486	 Preliminary neural model of intuitive processing. As proposed by Bar et al. (2006), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) functions as an integrator of stimulus input and processes this input toward a coarse representation or gist. We suggest that this coarse representation is, on a subjective level, reflected by an initial hunch or gut feeling that biases judgment and further stimulus analysis. Note that this does not exclude a parallel route directly linking early sensory areas with such responsible for a more detailed analysis (e.g., Plailly, Howard, Gitelman, & Gottfried, 2008). This route however will not be further addressed in the present article

ROCO_87120	 NRG-1/ErbB signaling has diverse, context-dependent physiological effects in the heart during development, homeostasis, and disease.Notes: Upon binding of NRG-1 to its ErbB3/4 receptor, dimerization with another ErbB2 (preferred), ErbB3, or ErbB4 receptor initiates a cascade of downstream signals in the heart. Signaling plays an important role in the following: development of the ventricular wall, arteriovenous (AV) valves, and the cardiac conduction system; homeostatic function of the heart via cardiomyocyte adaptability to stress and microvascular support; and the adaptation to disease such as myocardial infarction (MI) in both acute and chronic heart failure (CHF), as reflected by changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

ROCO_87185	  Why use the “stretch film” . The fundamental measurement made on the “stretch film” is the Cobb angle of the major curve while the spine is being stretched. The unique value of the “stretch film” is that is clearly identifies the area of major deformity, while the spinal column is compensated, over the pelvis, and the compensatory curves are well corrected. In the author’s experience, this type film is much easier to interpret than bending films, which, by their nature, are NOT made with the patient’s spine fully compensated and the compensatory curves minimized. Analyzing/measuring the “stretch film”. From the Cobb angle on the “stretch film,” a measurement (in mm) is made from the top edge of the top vertebra to the bottom edge of the bottom end vertebra on the concave side of the curve. An identical measurement is made from the same vertebrae on the convex side of the curve. The thicknesses of the intervertebral discs were then measured on the concave and convex sides of the curve. The thicknesses of the discs were summed together on the concave and convex sides, and then subtracted from the longitudinal measurement made on the concave and convex sides of the curve. If the subtracted sums were within 5 to 10 mm of one another, then it was assumed that the reconstructed spine would approach “straight” after the discs were removed. If the difference in the subtracted measurements was more than 10 mm, this indicated the need to either add another disc to the preoperative plan or take off bony wedges from the endplates to get the spine straight.

ROCO_87296	 Sir Benjamin William Rycroft, OBE, FRCS, 1902-67. Photograph by Walter Bird. Reproduced with the permission of Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology solely for this Medical History.Educated 1919-24 at St. Andrews University. After qualifying, he practiced as a general practitioner in Bradford, Yorkshire, from where, starting about five years later, he studied ophthalmology in London during the week, returning to work in Bradford at the weekends. On this regime he was admitted FRCS in 1931 and moved as Clinical Assistant to Sir Stewart Duke-Elder, knighted 1933, at St. George's Hospital35,36. Benjamin Rycroft published his first paper on human corneal transplantation in 193537. From 1940 to 1942 he served in the 31st General Hospital at Musgrave Park. Torpedoed and rescued on the way to Algeria, he later advised Allied Mediterranean Command for which he received the OBE36,38. Rycroft published the first book in the English Language describing corneal grafts39. Sir Benjamin's obituary says “he rode to show-standard and hunted”35. He was an accomplished organist, and “all his life he maintained an interest in the piano”35. As Honorary Consultant to the Zoological Society of London, he operated on tigers and horses among other animals. Rycroft, Examiner in Surgery to Queen's University, Belfast, encouraged by Dickie Hunter, asked candidates in surgery at Queen's viva questions on wild animal surgery40,41. The average adult female tiger requires a number 15 Magill-type tracheal tube41,42.

ROCO_87315	 High salt consumption may aggravate neovascular retinal diseases by stimulation of angiogenic factor production in RPE cells. Excess salt induces the release of growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) from RPE cells. Autocrine and paracrine TGF-β and FGF receptor signaling induces activation of the intracellular signal transduction pathways, including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathways, resulting in activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor of activated T cell 5 (NFAT5), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB). NFAT5 and HIF-1 induce the transcription of the VEGF gene, while NFAT5 and NF-κB induce the transcription of the AQP5 gene. NFAT5 also induces expression of the bFGF gene. The salt-induced secretion of VEGF, bFGF, and placental growth factor (PlGF) may stimulate the development of the central nervous system (CNV) and edema. Increased expression of AQP5 may improve water transport through the RPE, which may facilitate the development and/or resolution of edema, in dependence on the osmotic and hydrostatic gradients across the RPE.

ROCO_87764	 A new look at the B-DNA X-ray diffraction pattern photographed by Franklin and Gosling [reproduced with permission from (1)]. Thin solid lines show the layer lines with . One can see diffraction peaks centered at  (j = 0; n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ±5 and j = ±1, n = 0). K-coordinates of these peaks correspond to the maxima of the Bessel functions . The absence of diffraction peaks at j = 0, n = ±4 suggests that  This pattern is consistent with the one expected for a double helix with a radius a≈10 Å, a helical pitch ≈34 Å, ≈10 base pairs per helical turn and an azimuthal half-width ≈0.38π of the minor groove [Equations (1–8)]. Positions of the diffraction peaks may be explained within the ideal double-helix model [Equation (4)], but their meridional (kz) broadening cannot be attributed just to experimental factors, suggesting a significant contribution from the non-ideal helical structure of DNA [Equations (6–8)]. Indeed, the X-ray beam width should have a similar broadening effect on all layer lines. Its contribution to the diffraction peaks with n = ±3 and ±5 should be negligible, because the latter peaks are much broader than the peaks with n = ±1. The non-linear response of X-ray films might result in additional broadening of the more intense n = ±1, ±2, ± 3 peaks, but not the n =±5 peaks. The broadening of the n = ±5 peaks is also inconsistent with smearing along concentric arcs due to an imperfect vertical alignment of the molecules in the fibers. The contribution of this smearing, which was estimated based on the arcing of the n, j = 0 peaks, appears to be small and is consistent with the expected effect of thermal undulations of DNA (Figures 1 and 5). Thus, kz-cross-sections of the n=±5 peaks in the Franklin and Gosling pattern may be compared with the predictions of our model [Equations (7,8)], while unknown contributions of the x-ray beam width, film nonlinearity and imperfect DNA alignment may significantly affect the other peaks. This analysis yields information about the helical coherence of DNA, as discussed in the text and illustrated in Figure 5. Future studies of structural adaptation of DNA from kz-cross-sections of the other peaks might also be possible, provided that the contribution of experimental factors can be reduced or deconvoluted from the effects of sequence-related and thermal variations in the structure of the double helix.

ROCO_87846	 Relationship between the adult neurogenic niches and glioblastoma-initiating cells. GICs (light purple) have been found to play an important role in GBM aggressiveness and the resistance of the tumor to current treatments, making them an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. However, the design of new GIC inhibitors has proven difficult because their definition is nowadays still confused by the twilight zone of their origin. Indeed, whether GICs are derived from NPCs (yellow) or differentiated/mature cells remains uncertain. In any case, the vascular niche offered by the brain SVZ might be of interest to maintain GICs’ features, even if they are not indigenous. Undoubtedly, particular characteristics of this specific niche and its localization away from the tumor mass make it a significant resource for tumor recurrence. It is expected that future therapies targeting GBM, GICs and their specific environment will help to increase the dramatic survival rate of GBM patients.

ROCO_87921	 Rng3p is required the function of non-essential myosin-II Myp2p.A Myp2p-head/Myo2p-tail chimera construct was tested for its ability to rescue the growth of temperature-sensitive rng3-65 mutant cells under restrictive growth conditions (36°C). Plasmid transformants were grown under permissive conditions (25°C) on EMM-Leu− Ura− minimal media plates before re-streaking and subsequent incubation on plates at 36°C. Double drop-out plates were employed to accommodate the differing markers of the pGFP-myp2-head/myo2-tail (LEU2) and pGFP-rng3 (ura4+) plasmids. The vector alone transformant (left, negative control) carried empty LEU2 and ura4+ plasmids; the Rng3p transformant (center, positive control) carried an empty LEU2 vector and pGFP-rng3; and the Myp2p-head/Myo2p-tail transformant (right) carried pGFP-myp2-head/myo2-tail and an empty ura4+ vector.

ROCO_87946	 Visualization of the anatomic location of retrocrural space across diaphragmatic hiatuses section on CVH2.(A) On the upper section, the anterior margin of the retrocrural space (C) consists of the distal esophagus (D), the posterior border is thoracolumbar vertebra, both anterolateral borders are composed of the diaphragmatic crus (A), both posterolateral borders are made up of the mediastinal pleura (B). The aorta (E) is situated in the retrocrural space. The potential recess located between the diaphragmatic crura and the mediastinal pleura is the interior costophrenic sulcus (G). The peripancreatic fluid may drain into the retrocrural space via the esophageal hiatus (F). (B) On the lower section, the anterior border of the retrocrural space is open to the retroperotoneum, the posterior border is the lumbar vertebra, both lateral borders are made up of the diaphragmatic crus (A), the mediastinal pleura (B) constitutes the right posterolateral border. The inferior vena cava (K) and the both sides of adrenal glands (I) are distributed at the anterolateral direction of the retrocrural space. Furthermore, the peripancreatic fluid that originates from the pancreas (J) may drain into the retrocrural space across the aortic hiatus (H).

ROCO_87949	 Sagittal MRI of pregenual anterior cingulate and its proton magnetic resonance spectrum.(A) Sagittal T1-weighted MRI of the human brain showing location of 15×15×15 mm3 proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) acquisition voxel (yellow square) in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC). (B) Sample raw (jagged gray), baseline (light gray), and fit (solid red) MR spectra acquired from the pACC. The MR spectrum is a plot of the intensity of radiofrequency signal (ordinate axis) vs signal frequency (abscissa) in parts-per-million (ppm). The size (area under the curve) of each peak in the spectrum is proportional to a different biochemical species (metabolite) or small family of chemically related metabolites in the MRS voxel. The peak marked “Cr+PCr” at 3.02 ppm represents the sum of the energetic neurometabolites creatine and phosphocreatine. In our OCD pilot sample, pretreatment Cr+PCr level in pACC was predictive of OCD core and other symptoms at post-treatment follow-up.Abbreviations: Cr, creatine; OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder; MR, magnetic resonance; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PCr, phosphocreatine.
