ROCO_81935	 Scientists have traditionally recorded their research in paper notebooks, a format that provides great flexibility for capturing information. In contrast, Electronic Laboratory Notebooks frequently make use of forms or structured templates for capturing experiment records. Structured templates can provide cues that can improve record quality by increasing the amount of information captured and encouraging consistency. However, using the wrong cues can lead to a loss of personal elements of the experiment experience and frustrate users. This image shows two participants from one of our studies recording their experiment using a computer-based template

ROCO_82742	 The lifelong personal history of antigenic exposure (Immunobiography), represented as a Waddington Landscape, modulates the immune response to specific antigens. The response to every single antigenic molecule depends on the conditions of immune system (IS) when it meets the antigen. A variety of conditions, including socioeconomical status and antigenic ecospace, impinge upon the IS. The antigens can be met during life under different environmental conditions that can shape the immune response (i.e., what slope the ball will follow in its path). It is surmised that these environmental conditions act and are integrated as “fan in” signal by a bow tie-like module of conserved elements. These conditions include both early life and adult-late life events. As a whole, this process can lead to the creation at population level of a large heterogeneity of immune responsiveness to specific antigens.

ROCO_83714	 Slow solar wind source map.The sources are overlaid on an AIA 193 Å composite intensity image (blue), which we used to correctly coalign and place the EIS raster data in the mosaic. It shows all regions where coronal plasma is outflowing on open-field lines that reach close to the ecliptic plane. These are smoothed with a Gaussian filter to emphasize areas where there is a larger concentration of sources (red). The map is then filtered to identify weaker concentrations, and these are merged on to the image in green. The AIA images have been treated with an unsharp mask to bring out the details.

ROCO_83740	 Electric currents traversing an embryo (Source: Shi and Borgens, Dev Dynamics 1996;202:102. Courtesy of John Wiley & Sons). The blastopore, a classic organizer, has high electric conductance and current density. A steady blastopore current persists after early embryogenesis. The electric fields polarize the embryo and serve as cues for morphogenesis. These results confirmed earlier predictions. (Shang, Am J Chin Med 1989;17:119–27).

ROCO_85553	 Neuroanatomy of eye-movement control This figure illustrates the anatomy of the inputs the superior colliculus (SC) receives from the basal ganglia, noting that there is additionally a convergence of input from a diverse set of cortical regions. For clarity, other inputs to the SC have been omitted, but it should be remembered that the vestibular and cerebellar projections to the midbrain are vitally important in some aspects of saccadic control. The basal ganglia influence the SC via the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), which is the point of convergence between the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways. All three of these pathways are shown, with some simplifications. The direct pathway is from cortex to striatum to the SNr. The indirect is from cortex to striatum to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to the SNr. The hyperdirect is from cortex to STN to SNr. The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA - not shown) of the midbrain provide a dopaminergic input to the striatum. This schematic is based on descriptions in91 and adapted from134.

ROCO_85583	 Arrangement of eyes for magnetic resonance imaging scanning. The figure shows 16 paraformaldehyde-fixed chicken eyes embedded in low-melting-point agarose in a 2×2×4 array in readiness for an overnight magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Note that the eye in the lower-right quadrant of the uppermost layer was positioned in an inverted orientation to permit unambiguous identification of each eye in the resultant MRI image. In the remaining three eyes of the uppermost layer, it is possible to see the ink mark on the nasal cornea, which was used to indicate the original orientation of the eye in the head.

ROCO_85634	 There are four elements of a properly positioned patient for posterior cervical surgery. 1) Tongs are used to suspend the eyes and face from pressure, 2) the bed is placed into reverse trendelenberg to decrease venous pooling at the surgical site, 3) longitudinal bolsters (not seen) running laterally along the thoracoabdominal regions also decrease abdominal pressure and thus the venous pressure head at the surgical site, and 4) the neck is placed into a neutral to slightly flexed posture in order to decrease inter-laminar "shingling" or overlap. If a fusion is performed, the neck should be placed into a more lordotic postion prior to locking down the instrumentation.

ROCO_86166	 OCT image of the tear film and the central cornea (left), and simultaneous infrared image of the eye (right).Patients were asked to stare at a central target in the OCT. All OCT images of the ocular surface were acquired on the horizontal axis passing across the corneal apex. The instilled artificial tear (i.e., the adhesion marker) is detected by OCT as a two-layered structure localized onto the epithelial surface of the cornea, consisting of an outer band (OB) of high reflectivity and an inner band (IB) of low reflectivity. The retention time of the double-band structure (DB) onto the epithelial surface of the cornea was considered an index of the adhesive properties of the corneal surface (see text).

Triads are drawn progressively separated and stripped of components from left to right. α channels, in blue, are grouped in couplons that face the junctional gap. They undergo concerted activation, pictured as a Ca2+-mediated interaction that propagates very rapidly in the narrow gap, then stops at the edges of the couplon. Sequential activation is attributed to β channels (green), facing the wide parajunctional space. Ca2+-mediated activation there should propagate more slowly, but freely, without defined structural bounds. “Mixed” events are not excluded in this view.

ROCO_87234	 3D image of absolute distance difference calculation. The horizontal reference planes are perpendicular to the coronal plane and therefore appear in a two-dimensional fashion. The distance was measured from each landmark perpendicular to the FH plane. The subsequent distances of the Sor-, Z-, and FH planes were calculated and indicated as (Sor to FH) + (FH toU6) for Sor-U6, (Z to FH) + (FH to U6) for Z-U6, and FH to U6 for both left and right sides to ensure real 3D distance measurement between the planes. The absolute distance differences were calculated as the distance difference between left and right sides for each plane in millimeters.

Fractional anisotropy was measured in the voxel of interest (filled red square) of the diffusion scan. In the tissue sections, multiple fields of the corpus callosum were photographed in a square grid pattern (open red squares) and coded for analysis. Tissue sections included the cingulate gyrus, which was used as a landmark for the medial border (dashed line) of the grid of fields to be photographed.

ROCO_87882	 Robot-assisted nephroureterectomy without patient's repositioning, using a hybrid port. A 12-mm camera port (■) is placed at the superior umbilical region and two 8-mm robotic ports (●) are placed at the lateral rectus margin (first), 3–4 cm below the umbilicus and in the midline between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process (second). A dual 8–12-mm assistant hybrid port (◙) is placed between the umbilicus and pubic symphysis, which allows to be intubated with an 8-mm robotic arm. After the robotic nephrectomy is completed, the robotic axis is switched for the distal ureterectomy and the configuration of robotic ports is changed. Thus, the port for first robotic instrument arm during nephrectomy becomes an assistant port during bladder cuff excision, the port for the second robotic instrument arm becomes the dominant hand and the assistant port is converted to the nondominant hand
