The approach taken here has been to classify each manifestation (i.e., the set of all synonyms) according to its most specific label among the UMLS semantic types. This means that diseases will generally be assigned as diagnoses, while symptoms or other forms of abnormality may receive more than one type. The latter is especially likely for terms pertaining to laboratory findings or physical examination, which can belong to multiple classes depending on context (e.g., a \"high white blood cell count\" would be a manifestation under microscopic pathology but could conceivably be reclassified as a symptom in other circumstances).
