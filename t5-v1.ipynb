Her left extremity became swollen one year following surgery. Several abnormal dilated lymph vessels are clearly delineated in the left calf, which extend to the inner thigh (small arrows). In the contralateral normal extremity, a few lymphatic vessels show a discontinuous outline with relatively low signal intensity (small arrows).
