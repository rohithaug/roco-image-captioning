## Langchain with LLM

The notebook compiles the code for our experimenation with MedAlpaca 13B model. 

## Instructions: 

We use [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) framework along with [Llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) library for running the LLM. Its necessary to install both of them before running the noteboook.

MedAlpaca 13B model can be downloaded from [Hugging Face models](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/medalpaca-13B-GGML). 

## Running the notebook:

The notebook generates **llm_result.txt** which has the required rationale for training the image captioning models.
